Through working with design systems over the last few years, I've grown a list of some helpful resources, tools and examples I've used. I keep this list updated so come back soon, ya hear!

## Design Systems

Here is a list of fantastic Design Systems that I reference and admire.

### Fluent UI by Microsoft

[Fluent UI ](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#) is Microsoft's Design System for cross-platform applications, such a Office 365. There are multiple component libraries which implement the Fluent design language for React, Native and React Native experiences.

The launch of Fluent included [a really snazzy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miM6mBAfA8g), as well as [an article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996748/microsoft-fluent-design-mobile-office-apps-new-updates-features)

### Encore by Spotify

Encore is a really interesting take on Design Systems, because it's not one design system, but a heirachy of Design Systems from global to product level. Unfortunately the websites aren't public, but [there is a fantastic article on their website](https://spotify.design/article/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify), as well as some talks on YouTube.

### Balance by Reckon

What? I can't take inpiration from a Design System I worked on?

### ChakraUI

Personally, I think the best design systems aren't the ones built for the masses, but the opinionated ones built for purpose by a company. Still, if you need to reference some high-quality components, [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started) is not bad at all.

## Tools

### [Playroom by Seek](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom)

![Playroom in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seek-oss/playroom/master/images/demo.gif)

[Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) is a wonderful code-oriented design environment where you can use your Design System components to see how layouts will look on a variety of screen sizes. It can be deployed alongside your existing design system documentation.

### [Contrast](https://usecontrast.com/)

Contrast is a sleek macOS menubar app for quick access to WCAG color contrast ratios. I use it very reguarly while designing interfaces or design systems. I am quite a big fan of it's creators, [Matt D Smith](http://mds.is/) and [Sam Soffes](https://soff.es/).

### [Docz](https://www.docz.site/)

Docz is great for getting your first documentation website up and going. It's a great framework but it has limitations. If you needs grow or you need specific features, you will eventually decide to make a custom site.

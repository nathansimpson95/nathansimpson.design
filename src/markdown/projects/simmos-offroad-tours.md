Simmos Offroad Tours is 4WD Tourism Company in Orange NSW, providing winery tours, scenic 4wd tours and camping holidays in the central west of New South Wales.

The logo was designed when I was starting to take an interest in graphic design. The logo was made in Microsoft Office Publisher originally, but was later reconstructed in Adobe Illustrator, once I was confident in graphic design.

Over the years, I have designed everything from the logo, to flyers, to a custom Wordpress website.

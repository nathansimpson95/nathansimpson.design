ITC Learning is an eLearning Consultancy in North Sydney, comprised of 15 people. I started working at ITC Learning as a junior eLearning Developer, but my experience in web development quickly gave me the reputation of “the web guy”. After months of planning and pitching to the technology manager, I eventually convinced him that I should rebuild the company website, replacing the existing site that was built in an eLearning software and was difficult to maintain and expand.

We built the site on Wordpress, as I wasn’t the only one that would maintain the site. We also installed a ‘page builder’ plugin to allow other team members to make changes. The site has a custom theme, based on Bootstrap CSS. My skills in development allowed me to create custom plugins to handle registrations for webinars and events, using various APIs.

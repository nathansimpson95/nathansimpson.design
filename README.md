# Nathan's React Portfolio Site

Welcome to the GitHub repo of my new portfolio site! When I decided to remake my site, I wanted to utilise the opportunity to learn some modern frontend development technologies that I hadn't been able to use previously. This includes React, a popular component-based interface builder framework, which is incredibly popular in the local and global Javascript development circles I have been a part of.

## Technologies I learnt in the making of this site.

- React
- Webpack
- Express
